# <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

ClashDiscord is a discord bot written in Python that, while having a great many uses and commands, focuses _primarily_ on discord member management. This entails, but is not limited to, adding an uninitiated role to incoming members, allowing members to give themselves roles based on their clash of clans profile, and focusing on discord server security.

Non-management commands include, but are also not limited to, returning player or clan information based on their tag, getting troop levels and how close they are to max for their town hall as well as total max, who can donate the best of a specific troop in a clan, war information, cwl lineup, cwl war, and cwl clan member scores.

# <a id="setup"></a>Setup

Getting ClashDiscord set up in your discord server can be somewhat confusing, but never fear for I am here.

1. invite ClashDiscord to your discord server

   - [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=649107156989378571&permissions=1239433964608&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

2. claim your user in ClashDiscord

   - `client user claim`
     - this will claim you as a user
     - _this can be done in any claimed guild_

3. claim your discord server

   - `client guild claim`
     - this will claim your discord server and add you as the guild admin within ClashDiscord
     - guild is what the discord API calls a server

4. link a player to your user

   - `client player claim` `player tag` `api key`
     - claims the requested player and links it to your discord user
     - _this can be done in any claimed guild_
     - getting your api key is annoying, but for everyoneâ€™s security this is necessary

5. link a clan to your guild

   - `client clan claim` `clan tag`
     - claims a clan and links it to the claimed guild
     - your active player **must** be in the clan
     - _this is also for security_

6. link existing roles to your server

   - claim clan roles
     - `client clanrole claim` `clan tag` `role mention`
       - links the clan role to a claimed clan
       - _mentionrole means you have to @mention the role_

   B. claim rank roles

   - `client rankrole claim` `rank` `role mention`
     - links the rank role to a discord role
       - leader
       - co-leader
       - elder
       - member
       - uninitiated
         - _this means they aren't verified or they aren't in a claimed clan_

7. use clash discord, you are set up

# <a id="setup-summary"></a>Setup Summary

- invite Clash Discord to your server
- claim your discord user
- claim the guild
- claim your player
- claim your clan
- claim the necessary roles

# <a id="usage"></a>Usage

ClashDiscord is largely **command** focused, meaning it doesn't do anything that it is not told to do. The only exception to this is when a member joins. If a server has claimed an uninitiated role, then they will be given that role, otherwise nothing will happen. The other action ClashDiscord will take is if it detects a role being deleted from discord it will delete the database instance of that role.

Once setup is complete you will be able to interact with ClashDiscord using the prefix `/` and run the commands as desired.
